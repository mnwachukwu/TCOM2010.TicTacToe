A text console based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players that can be played on the same computer, in the same program (also known as "hot seat" gaming). This was written for the Instructions and Usability Test assignment in my TCOM 2010 W3 Fall 2024 class. The game is simple and serves as a subject to instruct a complete novice on how to write and build a game of Tic-Tac-Toe using C#.

If you would like to try the code out, without using Visual Studio (my [Instructions](#) for this assignment do not require the use of Visual Studio), then visit [.Net Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) to give it a shot! All you need to do is copy the contents of [Program.cs](https://github.com/mnwachukwu/TCOM2010.TicTacToe/blob/main/TCOM2010.TicTacToe/Program.cs), the main program file, into the code editor (it's the larger text box on top), overwriting what's already there. Then click "Run" (located in the top bar menu) to see it in action! If there is one nearby, try playing with a friend or family member!

Be sure to set the Compiler type to .Net 8 (or Latest), or the code will not run!
