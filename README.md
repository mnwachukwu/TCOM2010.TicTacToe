A text console based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players that can be played on the same computer (also known as "hot seat" gaming). This was written for the Instructions and Usability Test assignment in my TCOM 2010 W3 Fall 2024 class. The game is simple and serves as a subject to instruct a novice on how to write and build a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

If you would like to try the code out, without opening Visual Studio (my assignment does not require the use of Visual Studio), then visit [.Net Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) to give it a shot!

Be sure to set the Compiler type to .Net 8, or the code will not run!
